    "The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite measure of a country's development, based on three main dimensions: health, education, and income.\n",
    "This project explores how HDI relates specifically to health indicators, focusing on life expectancy, child mortality, and health expenditure.\n",
    "We aim to understand if and how a country's health outcomes correlate with its development level."
